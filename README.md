# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning
Coursera-Introduction to Deep Learning by National Research University Higher School of Economics

This was intense course on deep learning it gave me brief overview about Perceptron, Multilayer Perceptron, Convultional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Network and etc.

In the final week there was Programming Assignment Image Captioning Final Project. Which gave me a broader view that deep learning model can be used for many more processes , then we imagine.
